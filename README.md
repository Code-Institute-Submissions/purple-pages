# Purple Pages

## An online notice board for your local community.

Django web application utilising Bulma CSS framework, Postgres DB, Stripe payments and Heroku hosting.

## Premise

The basic premise of this application is to create a subscription based online ‘notice board’ on which local communities can advertise events, products and services. I have drawn inspiration from a combination of printed local directory type publications (e.g. Yellow Pages) and physical community notice boards as found in the centre of villages and towns all over the UK. Users of the application will be able to advertise their event, product or service on up to 5 boards for a minimal fee.

Initially the notice boards will be segregated into UK postcode districts. Districts are the second largest geographical used by the post code system and are represented by the first 2-4 characters of a standard UK postcode (e.g. W1 xxx). There are approximately 2,960 active districts in the UK and in the real world these represent communities with an average size of 22,000 people. The list of districts will come from a free online resource, see credits.

## Demo

## UX

I wanted the design of the site to be ‘clean’ and minimal with the notice boards themselves taking cues from a physical notice board found in town/village centres, local shops etc. E.g. lots of individual ads or various sizes pinned to the board in a loose grid format.

I have decided to use Bulma CSS framework to build the front-end templates as I like the clean look of the styles and also particularly the ‘tiles’ component which lends itself well to a notice board type look.

The colour scheme of the site will be purple and is complementing colours to reflect the application’s name.
